Coursework 2 Project Scope:

Main software used - RoboDK
	- email Mr. Bittu regarding the license for the same.

It will be a 2 arm robotic manipulator simulation performing the tasks, where it will be run by a python script that will command the robot what to do and at what stage of the cooking progress to do what.

The main sensors used in this coursework are the following:

- Weight sensor: a scale that the robot will use to ensure the ingredients are measured correctly before dispensing.
- Camera: classifies, identifies and recognizes the type of ingredient.
- Temperature sensors: to ensure the heat is constant throughout the cooking process

Robot scope:

- Picking, dropping, pouring and mixing the ingredients 
- Can pick the ingredients (represented by balls) from the shelves
- Can drop the ingredients into the utensils
- Can pick the needed utensil (pot/pan etc) and place it on the electric stove
- Can interchange the tooling (gripper/spatula etc) as and when required
- Can switch on or off the electric stove 

Out of scope:

- Robot cannot clean up, or wash the dishes.
- It cannot open and close the cupboards (hence open shelves)
- Cannot switch on or off the electric stove (will be done by the user)

Project Plan:

Week 24 – PPT on 8 April – Final Submission 13 April 
Week 1 March – Brainstorming and report submission for CW1 
Week 2 March – Finalize of simulation – What is expected. First trial of simulation
Week 3 March – 50 % of programming should be done 
Week 4 March – First draft should be ready for review 
Week 1 April – Collect feedback and do any changes – Slides and Practice 
Week 2 April – Submit and presentation

Salma and Akansha will focus on the RoboDK simulation
Reia will design the tablet interface with python.
