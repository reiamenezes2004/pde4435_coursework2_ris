Home Kitchen Robot - UR10e

The UR10e Home Kitchen Robot is a smart GUI-based robotic cooking assistant built with Python and Tkinter. It integrates a UR10e robotic arm via the RoboDK API to automate cooking tasks like preparing an Omelette. The interface includes a favourites system, recipe database, restaurant recommendations, timer controls, and emergency stopâ€”all designed for an interactive touchscreen experience.

How to Run:
1) Install RoboDK and open the robot program - PDE4435 SIM 25 March
2) Install a Python application - PyCharm was used in this case. Python 3.12.0 was the version used
3) While ensuring the RoboDK application is still open, open any Python application, inside open the folder - homekitchenrobotgui
4) Inside the python application, ensure the following dependancies are installed (come with Python already):
  - tkinter

  - datetime
  - random
  - threading
  - winsound (Windows only)
  - time
